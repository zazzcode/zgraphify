# seeding. Without this, "how does the frontier cache work" seeds on "how"/
# "the"/"work" (which prefix-match prose labels like "Working Principles" at 100x)
# instead of "frontier"/"cache", and lands in the wrong part of the graph. Applied
# to query terms only — node text is never filtered, so a symbol literally named
# `work` stays findable via explain/path. `work`/`works`/`working` are included
# because "how does X work" / "how X works" is the most common question phrasing.

# Non-English question words are just as damaging (#1900): in a mostly-English
# code corpus, German "wie"/"funktioniert" are rare, so they get HIGH IDF weight

# carries a curated German set plus a trimmed French/Spanish/Portuguese/Italian
# set of question/filler words. Diacritics are kept intact (the query tokenizer
# does not NFKD-strip).
#
# Collision tradeoff: a few foreign stopwords are also English content words.
# We include high-German-value ones like "die"/"hat" (the all-stopword fallback
# in _query_terms and the unfiltered find_node path keep an English "die"/"hat"
# query workable), but deliberately OMIT "war"/"bald" (German was/soon) so
# English queries about "war" or "bald" are not clobbered. On the Romance side
# we likewise omit "comment" (FR how), "come" (IT how), "son"/"sin"/"con" (ES),
# and "pour"/"des" (FR) — all too common as English/code terms.

    """Select BFS seed nodes, stopping when score drops too far below the top.

    Prevents high-frequency noise terms (error, exception) from stealing seed
    slots from a dominant identifier match. When FooBarService scores 1000 and
    error nodes score 1.0, only FooBarService is seeded — the score gap is 99.9%
    which is well above the 20% threshold that would allow additional seeds.

    That same gap_ratio cutoff has a failure mode on multi-term natural-language
    queries: if one term happens to hit an EXACT label match on a node that is
    otherwise unrelated to the query's intent (e.g. a common word that is also
    used as an unrelated identifier or field name elsewhere in the corpus), it
    can outscore every SUBSTRING match on the query's other, actually-relevant
    terms by ~1000x (see `_EXACT_MATCH_BONUS` vs. `_SUBSTRING_MATCH_BONUS`).
    The 20%-gap cutoff then silently discards all of those substring-tier
    seeds, so the BFS traversal only ever explores the neighborhood of the one
    unrelated exact match — see #1445.

    When `G` and `terms` are supplied, this guarantees at least one seed per
    distinct query term that has any match at all, so one term's incidental
    collision cannot starve out the others. Ties within a term are broken by
    graph degree (structural centrality), so an isolated incidental match
    doesn't out-rank a real, well-connected hub for that term.

    Coverage scaling in _score_nodes (#1602) now dampens a lone collision's
    exact tier on multi-term queries, which brings label-matching relevant
    nodes back inside the gap window; this per-term guarantee remains
    load-bearing for relevant nodes matched only via substrings, whose flat
    scores a dampened collision can still exceed.
