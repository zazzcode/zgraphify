"""C# receiver-typed member-call resolution (#1609).

`recv.Method()` where `recv` is a typed field / property / parameter / local must
resolve to the receiver TYPE's method — not a bare same-named match. Before this,
C# had no member-call resolver: the bare method name matched any same-named method
in the corpus, so `_server.Save()` silently mis-bound to an unrelated `Cache.Save()`
(a WRONG edge, not just a missing one). Resolution is by receiver type with the
single-definition god-node guard; an untypable receiver produces no edge.
