# Spec Builder Skill — User Guide

How to use the **spec-builder** skill to write deliverable specifications.

## What it does

Helps you draft a deliverable specification for a bounded deliverable: a feature slice,
bug fix, refactor, milestone slice, or other implementation unit.

The stable rule is:

```text
one deliverable = one deliverable specification
```

The flexible rule is delivery topology:

```text
a worktree / branch / PR may contain one deliverable, multiple deliverables, or a
single-lane stack of branches
```

The skill conducts an interactive dialogue, captures decisions and acceptance criteria,
and produces a self-contained specification. The specification includes the approved
review shape and decomposition rationale, execution sequence, definition of done, halt
conditions, run-log protocol, paste-ready implementation prompt, and final
Implementation And Review Change Log. There is no separate execution document.

The skill writes deliverable specifications. It does **not** implement product code.

## Team integration rule

This is a team repository. Agents may commit to their feature branch and push their
feature branch when the specification says to, but they must never merge directly to the
repo's confirmed integration branch.

All integration happens through human PR review. Specifications should use wording like
"submit a PR to `{{ integration-branch }}`", "after the PR lands", or "after the lower
PR lands" rather than instructing an agent to merge.

## When to use it

- You have a bounded deliverable and want to capture scope, decisions, and ACs before
  implementation.
- You are defining a milestone branch with multiple ordered deliverables and specifications that
  will be reviewed as one PR.
- You are defining sibling deliverables that will be reviewed as separate PRs.
- You are defining a stacked review lane where branches are stacked inside one lane
  worktree using `gh-stack`.
- You are updating an existing specification after Owner-approved scope or contract changes.

## Delivery topologies

The skill should help choose the simplest topology that matches the intended review
artifact.

- **Single-deliverable branch** — one deliverable, one specification, one branch/PR.
- **Milestone branch** — multiple deliverables and specifications in one worktree and branch, one
  shared run log, one PR. Use when the milestone is reviewed as a whole.
- **Sibling branches** — multiple independently reviewable branches/PRs for one
  milestone. Use when deliverables do not depend on each other strongly enough to need
  a stack.
- **Stacked review lane** — stacked branches inside one lane worktree using
  `gh-stack`. Use only when separate review/merge boundaries or lower-layer/upper-layer
  dependency justify stack overhead.

Do not create stacked worktrees. Stacks are branches inside one worktree.

For features and deliverables, this topology decision is made during specification. The
approved specification must say whether the work will be reviewed as one PR, one
milestone PR, sibling PRs, stacked PRs, or a large exception. If implementation later
needs a different shape, stop for Owner sign-off, update the affected specification
sections in place, and record the change in the Implementation And Review Change Log
before continuing.

## How to invoke

Invoke the skill by name, for example `/spec-builder` or `@.agents/skills/spec-builder/SKILL.md`. Then
describe the deliverable or milestone.

## What to tell the skill at invocation

State these up front when you know them:

- **Delivery topology** — single-deliverable branch, milestone branch, sibling
  branches, or stacked review lane.
- **Deliverable slug** — kebab-case identifier used in specification filenames.
- **Milestone / effort slug** — when multiple specifications share one run log or PR.
- **Review artifact** — one PR for the whole milestone, separate sibling PRs, or
  stacked PRs.
- **Decomposition rationale** — why that review shape is correct and which alternatives
  were rejected.
- **Execution tracking system** — local run log only, Zazz Board, Jira, or another
  tracker, including stable IDs/URLs when known.
- **Implementation coordination** — one lead implementation agent only, or a lead
  implementation agent coordinating subagents by phase, task, branch, or verification
  slice.
- **Conflict and QA model** — file areas that require ordered work to avoid overwrites,
  and whether fresh-context QA agents should check functionality, performance, code
  hygiene, standards, or another quality dimension.

The skill will ask follow-ups on scope boundaries, decisions, acceptance criteria,
run-log shape, execution tracking, subagent delegation boundaries, and review
boundaries.

You do not need to arrive with every answer. If topology, deliverable boundaries,
reference data, acceptance criteria, or test evidence are unclear, the skill should
interview you in small batches and propose defaults for confirmation. It should not
produce a final specification that leaves an implementation agent guessing about what proves the
deliverable is done.

## Output paths

- **Specification**:
  `<DOCS_ROOT>/specifications/<slug>.md` unless the repo declares a more specific naming
  policy. The repo's operating model determines whether `specifications/` is tracked,
  ignored, mirrored to Zazz Board/Jira, or promoted after merge to GitHub Wiki,
  Confluence, or another durable surface.
- **Milestone branch specifications**:
  `<DOCS_ROOT>/specifications/<milestone>-spec-<n>-<slug>.md` or another
  Owner-approved consistent naming pattern under `specifications/`.
- **Run log**:
  default local path: `<DOCS_ROOT>/ephemeral/<slug>-run-log.md`; for milestones or
  stacks, use `<DOCS_ROOT>/ephemeral/<milestone-or-lane-slug>-run-log.md`. This
  directory is usually excluded from Git by repo-local or bare-repo exclude rules unless
  the repo explicitly chooses committed execution history. Zazz Board notes and external
  tracker records are also valid when declared. Repos that do not use Zazz Board may rely
  exclusively on `<DOCS_ROOT>/ephemeral/`. When the Owner uses Zazz Board, use it as the
  centralized place for run logs, handoff notes, QA findings, and related execution
  information that must be available across worktrees, agents, and sessions.
- **External specification mirror or final storage**:
  Zazz Board, Jira, GitHub Wiki, Confluence, or another repo-declared system, with a
  stable identifier linked from the PR and implementation prompt when used.

## What you should have ready

- A rough sketch of the deliverable or milestone and why it is needed.
- The intended review shape: one PR, one milestone PR, sibling PRs, stacked PRs, or a
  large exception.
- Whether implementation progress should be tracked only in the run log, in Zazz Board,
  in Jira, or in another system.
- Whether the implementation prompt should assume a single lead agent or a lead agent
  that may delegate scoped phases/tasks to subagents.
- Any file ownership risks where work should be ordered in one worktree instead of
  delegated concurrently.
- Which independent QA passes should run with fresh context.
- Any constraints that already exist: legacy compatibility, performance targets,
  coordination with other work in flight.
- Known source documents: feature docs, architecture docs, standards, prior specifications.

## After approval

Implementation starts from the specification itself and the run log. A fresh implementing agent
reads the specification, resolves open questions, maintains the run log, executes the phases,
and dispatches a verifier when the definition of done is complete.

After greenlight, material contract changes during implementation or review are governed
by `spec-driven`: update the affected specification sections in place,
record the audit entry in the Implementation And Review Change Log, and keep progress
and evidence in the run log.
