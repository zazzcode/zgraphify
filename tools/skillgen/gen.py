"""skillgen: render graphify's committed skill artifacts from edited fragments.

Build-time only. Nothing here ships in the wheel. Fragments under
``tools/skillgen/fragments/`` are the single source of truth a human edits; the
files under ``graphify/skill*.md`` and ``graphify/skills/<platform>/references/``
are generated, committed artifacts. This module renders those artifacts and
guards them against drift.

Usage (from the repo root)::

    python -m tools.skillgen                 # regen every platform's artifacts
    python -m tools.skillgen --platform claude
    python -m tools.skillgen --check         # byte-diff render vs committed + expected/, exit 1 on drift
    python -m tools.skillgen --audit-coverage# per host: assert every heading of that host's own v8 body single-homes in its render
    python -m tools.skillgen --schema-singleton  # assert the file_type enum is byte-identical everywhere
    python -m tools.skillgen --monolith-roundtrip# assert each monolith == v8 modulo the enum unification
    python -m tools.skillgen --always-on-roundtrip# assert each always_on/*.md reproduces its former constant
    python -m tools.skillgen --bless         # rewrite expected/ from the current render

The render is idempotent: the core template's per-platform slots are filled in a
fixed order, the reference index is sorted by name, output is LF-newline, and no
timestamp or version is ever written into a generated file.

# Immutable coverage baseline for --audit-coverage. The working-tree skill bodies

# every other split host has its own graphify/skill-<host>.md. Auditing each host
# against ITS OWN v8 body is the per-host guard: a drop that only hits one host
# (e.g. trae losing its AGENTS.md integration section) is invisible when every
# host is checked against claude's monolith, so the audit must be per-host.
#
# Baselines are pinned to the immutable pre-split commit SHA, NOT the moving

# original monolith bodies / inline constants, so a symbolic ref would compare
# the split against itself (vacuous) or fail to find the old constants. The SHA
# is an ancestor of origin/v8 and is fetched under the CI `fetch-depth: 0`.

# The lean core is one shared template across every split host, so a few v8
# headings deliberately do NOT survive verbatim in a given host's render. These
# are intentional consolidations, not content drops, and the audit must not flag
# them. Two classes:
#
# 1. SHARED_INTRO_ALLOWLIST — the lean intro consolidation. "## What graphify is
#    for" is the lean intro the core carries; the minimal v8 bodies (kilo, vscode)
#    had verbose intro prose with no such heading, while the richer v8 bodies
#    already had it. Listing it documents the wave-2/3 intro consolidation; it
#    single-homes in every render, so it is never itself a coverage hole. The enum
#    unification (Decision A) is prose, not a heading, and is guarded separately by
#    schema-singleton.
#
# 2. _CONSOLIDATION_ALLOWLIST[host] — per-host v8 headings the shared lean core
#    re-homes under a reworded or re-leveled heading while preserving (or
#    enriching) the content. The two minimal v8 bodies, kilo (414 L) and vscode
#    (258 L), are the only hosts affected: the shared core is a richer superset
#    that renamed their terse step/part headings and promoted kilo's
#    "### Kilo-specific rules" to "## Kilo-specific rules". The mapped content
#    lives in the core or a reference under the new heading; the audit confirms
#    every NON-allowlisted v8 heading is single-homed, so a genuine drop (e.g.
#    trae's native AGENTS.md integration) still fails loudly.
#
# Adding a heading here is a deliberate, reviewed act: it asserts "this v8
# heading was consolidated on purpose and its content is covered elsewhere."
